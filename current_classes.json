There we can maintain social distancing in an outdoor setting. Unfortunately, it was not available for the camps.\n\nWe are sorry for any inconvenience. This is a crazy time we are in and are trying to do the best we can. If you are interested in enrolling your child in our Pre-Teen class (every Saturday morning from September 12th to October 17th) let us know and we will transfer your tuition to the class.
