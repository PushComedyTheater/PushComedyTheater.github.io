That means the performers will have to be quarantined together or in the same socially distanced pod.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teams can use their phone or webcam to capture their performance which will be broadcast via a livestream link we’ll provide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teams will receive a one-word suggestion moments before their set, and can perform any style of improv they choose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Performances will be voted on by the audience and a team of judges, with the winning team moving on to the next round. While teams will be judged on their set, poor lighting and audio can hamper your performance. Make sure lighting and audio issues are taken into account when choosing a location to perform. Camera operators are allowed as long as they are in your quarantine or socially distanced pod.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While we can’t pay performers (aside from the cash prizes for the top 4 teams), we want you to have an opportunity to make money. </p>\n<p>During your set, we will display a graphic with your Paypal or Venmo handle. </p>\n<p>Audience members will be encouraged to donate directly to the groups and/or theaters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As much as Zoomprov has helped survive this past year… we’re ready for some (safe) face-to-face improv.</p>",
