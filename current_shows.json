This one-woman show will let you see inside their uniqueness. (and maybe into yours)\n</p>\n<p>(Art Grad School Graduate Disclaimer about being the unique, non-confirming individualist: in grad school it’s very rare that anyone actually wants to sit down with you in your “studio”, listen to you drone on about your craft and why this piece is working or that piece isn’t working while sipping overpriced coffee from a bodega. It’s even more rare that they occasionally mumble thought-provoking questions in the abstract under their breath while you stammer and stumble about, grabbing sketches of this or that and shuffling through drawings while being fueled by anxiety and a need for a nugget of feedback on who you are and what your work means.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry, but nobody does that anymore. But we “Artists” try anyway. Out here grinding, y'all.\n</p>\n<p>&lt;Value Add Statement added for effect and also a Call to Action&gt;\n</p>\n<p>If you pay $11 for this performance, you will come away with empathy for the actress as she continually embarrasses herself. This show will make you feel better about your life, maybe forever.\n</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a 9 to 5’er in a secure job with paid over time and benefits or a post art grad school person, or a self-educated artist or just a creative in general, if you are a really successful lawyer or business owner- it doesn't matter what you do. This show will make everyone appreciate parts of themselves and their lives.\n</p>\n<p>You’re going to like the way you feel, I guarantee it. (but also no refunds, so…)\n</p>\n<p>The 5 “Artists” You Meet In Grad School (As told by Heidi Peelen)\n</p>\n<p>Friday, July 19th, 8pm\n</p>\n<p>Tickets $11\n</p>","type":"show"}]
