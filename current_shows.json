Learn the ins and outs of comedy from speakers including Emmy award winners, published writers, voice actors, theater directors, movie and TV stars, seasoned improvisers, sketch comedians, and more.  \n\nThe Spirit of Unconditional Performance Support : In my experience, the once simple and welcomed foundation of \"Yes And\" support of your scene partner eventually becomes a tricky ambiguous bedfellow along the improv journey. As a performer becomes more experienced there are lots of evolutionary positives, such as their confidence grows and their artist's voice expands; with all of this new growth and focus on oneself it's very easy to forget the basic ingredients, including the thing that made improv magic in the first place: Support. We will be discussing: What is the spirit of unconditional support? How to identify where it's lacking? And most importantly, How to correct it? \n\nAbout Whittney Millsap:\nWhittney Millsap is an actor and improviser from Atlanta, Ga.
