BUT you could pay $11, change a life just by meeting some artsy people and not resent your poop.\n\nIf you went to Art Grad School you met these people.\n\nIf you didn’t go to Art Grad school but you shared a campus with them, you met these people.\n\nIf you’ve ever seen art on a coffee shop wall or a poster about their upcoming art show on a coffee shop wall or ever just walked into a coffee shop with a coffee shop wall you’ve met these people in one way or another.\n\nYou don’t have to be an artist to meet artists. You’ve met them already. You can meet them all over again from the safety of an audience seat (and somewhere other than a coffee shop).\n\nThis one-woman show will isolate and re-introduce those 5 artists that you met (or didn’t meet) (or haven’t met yet), poke fun at itself and at the artists portrayed in each category of the contemporary artist.\n\nDisclaimer: the artist working today and not necessarily just contemporary art (as in the movement) because who has ever actually MET contemporary art or a movement in a coffee shop?\n\nDespite these 5 artist’s best efforts to be the unique, non-conforming individualist, what unites them is that everybody is really unique in their own artsy way. This one-woman show will let you see inside their uniqueness. (and maybe into yours)\n\n(Art Grad School Graduate Disclaimer about being the unique, non-confirming individualist: in grad school it’s very rare that anyone actually wants to sit down with you in your “studio”, listen to you drone on about your craft and why this piece is working or that piece isn’t working while sipping overpriced coffee from a bodega. It’s even more rare that they occasionally mumble thought-provoking questions in the abstract under their breath while you stammer and stumble about, grabbing sketches of this or that and shuffling through drawings while being fueled by anxiety and a need for a nugget of feedback on who you are and what your work means.)\n\nSorry, but nobody does that anymore. But we “Artists” try anyway. Out here grinding, y'all.\n\n&lt;Value Add Statement added for effect and also a Call to Action&gt;\n\nIf you pay $11 for this performance, you will come away with empathy for the actress as she continually embarrasses herself. This show will make you feel better about your life, maybe forever.\n\nWhether you’re a 9 to 5’er in a secure job with paid over time and benefits or a post art grad school person, or a self-educated artist or just a creative in general, if you are a really successful lawyer or business owner- it doesn't matter what you do. This show will make everyone appreciate parts of themselves and their lives.\n\nYou’re going to like the way you feel, I guarantee it.

BUT you could pay $11, change a life just by meeting some artsy people and not resent your poop.\n</p>\n<p>If you went to Art Grad School you met these people.\n</p>\n<p>If you didn’t go to Art Grad school but you shared a campus with them, you met these people.\n</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever seen art on a coffee shop wall or a poster about their upcoming art show on a coffee shop wall or ever just walked into a coffee shop with a coffee shop wall you’ve met these people in one way or another.\n</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be an artist to meet artists. You’ve met them already. You can meet them all over again from the safety of an audience seat (and somewhere other than a coffee shop).\n</p>\n<p>This one-woman show will isolate and re-introduce those 5 artists that you met (or didn’t meet) (or haven’t met yet), poke fun at itself and at the artists portrayed in each category of the contemporary artist.\n</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: the artist working today and not necessarily just contemporary art (as in the movement) because who has ever actually MET contemporary art or a movement in a coffee shop?\n</p>\n<p>Despite these 5 artist’s best efforts to be the unique, non-conforming individualist, what unites them is that everybody is really unique in their own artsy way. This one-woman show will let you see inside their uniqueness. (and maybe into yours)\n</p>\n<p>(Art Grad School Graduate Disclaimer about being the unique, non-confirming individualist: in grad school it’s very rare that anyone actually wants to sit down with you in your “studio”, listen to you drone on about your craft and why this piece is working or that piece isn’t working while sipping overpriced coffee from a bodega. It’s even more rare that they occasionally mumble thought-provoking questions in the abstract under their breath while you stammer and stumble about, grabbing sketches of this or that and shuffling through drawings while being fueled by anxiety and a need for a nugget of feedback on who you are and what your work means.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry, but nobody does that anymore. But we “Artists” try anyway. Out here grinding, y'all.\n</p>\n<p>&lt;Value Add Statement added for effect and also a Call to Action&gt;\n</p>\n<p>If you pay $11 for this performance, you will come away with empathy for the actress as she continually embarrasses herself. This show will make you feel better about your life, maybe forever.\n</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a 9 to 5’er in a secure job with paid over time and benefits or a post art grad school person, or a self-educated artist or just a creative in general, if you are a really successful lawyer or business owner- it doesn't matter what you do. This show will make everyone appreciate parts of themselves and their lives.\n</p>\n<p>You’re going to like the way you feel, I guarantee it. (but also no refunds, so…)\n</p>\n<p>The 5 “Artists” You Meet In Grad School (As told by Heidi Peelen)\n</p>\n<p>Friday, July 19th, 8pm\n</p>\n<p>Tickets $11\n</p>","type":"show"}]
